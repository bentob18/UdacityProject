# UdacityProject
Github about an udacity project
# Installation
In this project we are using Jupyter Notebook on Kaggle, that has Python v3.7.12. We are also using sobre librarys such as:
1. Pandas
2. Numpy
3. Sci-kit Learn
4. Seaborn
# Motivation 
I did a project in my data science university about a decision tree classifier in the Brasília (Brazil) bicycle system with the objectives of answering those questions:
1. What are the overall patterns of bike usage in Brasília?
2. Are there differences in bike usage between weekdays and weekends?
3. What are the most popular start and end stations for bike trips?
# File descriptions
In this project we have 2 CSV files:
1. df_train.csv carries the information about each ride made during the year of 2018, from January to August, in a train dataset.
2. submission.csv carries the submission of some train tests.
# About the project
In this project my main objetive was try to get the best accuracy as possible in a decision tree classifier. After some tries and adding some criterions i achieved 88% of accuracy in my test dataset.
# Documentation
Udacity Project documentation is built with the analysis of a competition made in my university created by my teacher (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/edciedadosuniceub2022) and submited by me and some friends (Team "CamaradasDoPython") and consists in the usage of my own coding, separetely translated in a new notebook.
# Medium
I wrote a medium-like post about this project, if you have time please check it out:
