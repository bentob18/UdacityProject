# Installation
In this project we are using Jupyter Notebook on Kaggle, that has Python v3.7.12. We are also using sobre librarys such as:
1. Pandas
2. Numpy
3. Sci-kit Learn
# Motivation 
I did a project in my data science university about a decision tree classifier in the Bras√≠lia (Brazil) bicycle system.
# File descriptions
In this project we have 2 CSV files:
1. df_train.csv carries the information about each ride made during the year of 2018, from January to August, in a train dataset.
2. submission.csv carries the submission of some train tests.
# About the project
In this project my main objetive was try to get the best accuracy as possible in a decision tree classifier. After some tries and adding some criterions i achieved 88% of accuracy in my test dataset.
# Documentation
Udacity Project documentation is built with the analysis of a competition made in my university created by my teacher (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/edciedadosuniceub2022) and submited by me (Team "CamaradasDoPython") and consists in the usage of my own coding, separetely translated in a new notebook.
